- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **WebSocket**: Socket.IO
- **Dev Tools**: VS Code, npm, Chrome DevTools

## Dependencies

### Frontend

Installed via `npm install` inside the `frontend/` directory:

- `react`
- `react-dom`
- `react-scripts`
- `socket.io-client`

### Backend

Installed via `npm install` inside the `backend/` directory:

- `express`
- `socket.io`

## How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-app.git
cd chat-app
````

---

### 2. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install 
node index.js
```

> Backend runs on: `http://localhost:5050`

---

### 3. Start the Frontend

Open a new terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install 
npm start 
```

> Frontend runs on: `http://localhost:3000`

Make sure both servers are running in separate terminals.

## Features Implemented

* Simple login form (no auth, username only)
* Real-time chat using WebSockets
* Typing indicators (shows when a user is typing)
* Chat history display with system messages
* Responsive design for mobile and desktop
* Clean and readable UI with styled components

---

## Architecture & Flow

* When the React app loads, user submits a username via the login screen.
* After login, React connects to the Socket.IO server and sends/receives events like:

  * `send_message`: to broadcast a message
  * `typing`: to show typing indicators
  * `receive_message`: to update chat window for all users
* Server uses Socket.IO to broadcast messages and typing states to all clients in real-time.
